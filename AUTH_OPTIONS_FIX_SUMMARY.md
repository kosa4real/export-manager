# AuthOptions Export Fix Summary

## Problem

The build was failing because `authOptions` was not being exported from the NextAuth route file (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`). Multiple API routes were trying to import `authOptions` from this file, but it was only defined locally and not exported.

## Solution

Created a shared authentication configuration file and updated all imports to use the centralized configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `src/lib/auth-options.js`

- **Purpose**: Centralized authentication configuration
- **Exports**: `authOptions` object with all NextAuth configuration
- **Features**:
  - Credentials provider setup
  - JWT and session callbacks
  - Session strategy configuration
  - Custom sign-in page configuration

### 2. Updated `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`

- **Before**: Contained the full `authOptions` configuration locally
- **After**: Imports `authOptions` from the shared file
- **Reduced from**: ~60 lines to ~4 lines
- **Exports**: Only `GET` and `POST` handlers (as required by Next.js App Router)

### 3. Updated All API Routes

Fixed imports in the following files:

- `src/app/api/users/register/route.js`
- `src/app/api/supplies/route.js`
- `src/app/api/exports/[id]/route.js`
- `src/app/api/supplies/[id]/route.js`
- `src/app/api/supplies/stats/route.js`
- `src/app/api/suppliers/stats/route.js`
- `src/app/api/suppliers/[id]/route.js`
- `src/app/api/exports/route.js`
- `src/app/api/suppliers/route.js`

**Changed from**:

```javascript
import { authOptions } from "../auth/[...nextauth]/route";
// or
import { authOptions } from "../../auth/[...nextauth]/route";
// or
import { authOptions } from "@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route";
```

**Changed to**:

```javascript
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth-options";
```

## Benefits

1. **Build Fix**: Resolves the export error that was preventing builds
2. **Consistency**: All API routes now import from the same location
3. **Maintainability**: Auth configuration changes only need to be made in one place
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separates configuration from route handlers
5. **Reusability**: Auth options can be easily imported anywhere in the application
6. **Type Safety**: Centralized configuration reduces import path errors

## Files Updated

- ✅ `src/lib/auth-options.js` (new)
- ✅ `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/users/register/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/supplies/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/exports/[id]/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/supplies/[id]/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/supplies/stats/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/suppliers/stats/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/suppliers/[id]/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/exports/route.js`
- ✅ `src/app/api/suppliers/route.js`

## Verification

- All files pass syntax validation
- No diagnostic errors found
- Import paths are consistent across all API routes
- NextAuth configuration remains identical to original

The build error should now be resolved and all authentication functionality will continue to work as expected.
